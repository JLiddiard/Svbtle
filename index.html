How to get free, pre-released copies of your favorite authors' new books
NATHAN KONTNY
<p>
Ever find a brand new book on Amazon, just released today, and wonder how it already has all those reviews? Or glance at a book cover, and think, “this was printed before the book was released to the public, but it’s covered in testimonials from famous entrepreneurs, celebrities, and other writers.”
<p>
How do those reviewers get the book so early? How do I get in on this?
<p>
Here’s how I do it.
<p>
When we see a lot of other people looking at something, we become interested. It’s how our psychology works. So authors want their books surrounded with testimonials.
<p>
Publishing companies and their public relations (PR) staff do work to get those reviews. They’ll spread early editions of the book to other authors under that same publishing company, or mail it out to influential people in their rolodex.
<p>
But, I’m not a published author of a book, and I’m not famous, so I don’t have any PR person sending me free books from my favorite authors.
<p>
How can I fix this?
<p>
And it turned out, it was easy.
<p>
1. Scan Amazon
<p>
I religiously scan Amazon and the internet for new books that might be coming out from my favorite authors.
<p>
Amazon lists books for pre-order months ahead of when they actually get released. I don’t have a great automated way to do this, but I simply search Amazon for interesting things, especially from authors I already enjoy. Some strategic bookmarks to Amazon searches or Google Alerts might help.
<p>
Here’s an example:

Last year, I did a search for Malcolm Gladwell, one of my favorites, and there it was. Malcolm’s latest book David and Goliath was available for pre-order on Amazon.

2. Find the author’s email address

There are a ton of ways to accomplish this. Many authors simply list their email on their website. Or you could use WHOIS to find registration details of someone’s domain name.

Or simply guess. namelastname@gmail.com often works. Then, use Rapportive to check some of your guesses. After you have Rapportive installed, you can start a new email with that address in the To field, and if Rapportive has the email in their database, a profile will popup.

Or search Google for different combinations of “firstnamelastname@gmail.com”, “firstinitiallastname@gmail.com”, etc.

Or use Twitter to make the connection, or the authors contact form, or use LinkedIn’s InMail.
